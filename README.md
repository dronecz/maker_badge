# Maker badge
The Maker badge board is official badge board for Maker Faire´s in Czech republic. Main purpose is to show visitors/exhibitors name and/or project, but secondary goal is to have at each Maker Faire some interactive game so people can have more fun at the time of the visit.

This board supports Arduino and CircuitPython platform. 

CircuitPython will be **primary** platform for this board because it is very easy to use, and anybody who will buy board at some Maker Fair should be able very easily change (at least) her/his name on the display so anybody can know name of the person, when they start chating about something.  

I will try to add as many examples for both platforms, as I could, but I already saw few very interesting. 

## Board version

There are currently 3 revisions of the board:

- rev. A : this version was distributed by me and it was using **212 x 104 px** e-ink display with UC8151D driver
- rev. B : this board was assembled by me for Maker Faire Prague 2022 and it was using **250 x 122 px** e-ink display with SSD1680 driver from Make More. It contain same type of components as rev. A .  
- rev. C (with rev. B markings at the back): this board was assembled by PCBWay and it was using **250 x 122 px** e-ink display with SSD1680 driver from Make More. Some of the components are different because original parts was not available due to chip shortage. These boards were distributed at Maker Faire Brno 2022 (22 - 23/10/2022) and onwards.
